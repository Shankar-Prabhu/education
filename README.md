 Analyzing U.S. education data 

## Data Used
The dataset analyzed in this project is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project).
The original sources listed include the U.S. Census, the National Center for Education Statistics, and the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

## Files in Project
All files come in both pdf and Rmd format.

### overview.pdf/overview.Rmd
This file outlines the types of data used in the project. There are three categories: financial data (funding/expenditures), enrollment demographics (race/gender), and testing performances on standardized reading and math exams.
The following files analyze each of these three data categories

### financials.pdf/financials.Rmd
This file analyzes the funding and expenditures of U.S. schools. 
Key Findings
Overall, total funding and total expenditures are rising at similar rates. Also, funding per student and expenditures per student are also rising. In terms of revenue, the bulk of school funding comes from local and state revenue. The bulk of expenditures comes from instruction and support services. Additionally, funding varies significantly between states, sometimes even states that have similar populations or are in neighboring geographic regions.

### enrollment_demos.pdf/enrollment_demos.Rmd
This file analyzes the trends in enrollment demographics in U.S. schools.
Key Findings
White enrollment is decreasing, with its percentage share shifting primarily toward those who identify as Hispanic or multiracial. There are slightly more male students in the school system, with the percentage share of male and female remaining constant over time. This file only had analyzable data after 2009 due to missing data and data quality issues.

### testing_stats.pdf/testing_stats.Rmd
This file analyzes the testing performance on reading and math of students at U.S. schools.
Key Findings
Testing data is only high quality for 2013 and no other years. While this is disappointing, we can still analyze this particular year's testing performance. Females, on average, performed better than males on both reading and writing in 2013. The gap between the genders widened between 4th grade testing and 8th grade testing. Racial categories had varying differences, but unfortunately races had varying levels of data completness, rendering the conclusions not valid. 

Overall, I am concerned about the quality of this data even though it comes from reputable sources like the U.S. census and standardized testing boards. I wonder if some of the data collection issues are in themselves caused by racial or economic factors that make it harder/easier to collect data. It seems a worthy investment to focus on education data collection so that policymakers have more accurate information so they can craft better legislation and improve U.S. schools.
